With a background in both customer service and human resources, 
Iam skilled in understanding the needs of both clients and candidates, and able to connect them in a way that results in mutually beneficial partnerships. 
I am a strategic thinker and problem solver, able to proactively identify and address potential issues before they arise. 
I am also an excellent communicator, able to clearly and effectively convey information to clients, candidates, and team members. 
I am dedicated to helping clients achieve their goals and to finding the best fit for candidates,
